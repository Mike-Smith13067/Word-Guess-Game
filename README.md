# Word-Guess-Game

About:
    This is a simple game of hangman. 
    The player will try to guess the randomly chosen (from an array of classmates) name. 
    The player will only have 20 guesses.
    Wins and losses will be tracked until the page is reset.
    The game will also track and display each character tried to prevent repetitions (wasted guesses).
    A cancel button is present to quit and will direct the browser to the ESPN home page.
